# Redscreen4Linux

Bash script that set the screen to red vision.

Redscreen4Linux keeps your eye's dark adaption.  E.g. while you using your computer during star gazing. It should work with all GNU/Linux-desktops and works system-wide with all applications.

Provide Ubuntu/Mint deb-installer incl. icon and desktop-file in Release section. Makes usage easy. Just click on the Redscreen4Linux-icon and the screen switches to red. Another click ask you first before it switches to normal vision.
