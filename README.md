# Redscreen4Linux

Bash script that set the screen to red vision.

Redscreen4Linux keeps your eye's dark adaption.  E.g. while you using your computer during star gazing. It should work with all GNU/Linux-desktops and works system-wide with all applications.

I provide a **deb-installer** (Ubuntu/Mint,etc.) and a general **GNU/Linux installation script** (for all distributions) incl. icon and desktop-file at the [Release section](https://github.com/haniibrahim/Redscreen4Linux/releases). This makes usage easy. Just click on the Redscreen4Linux-icon and the screen switches to red. Another click on the icon prompt you first (if Zenity or Kdialog is installed) before it switches to normal vision.
